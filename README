To run the program, you open ./cfiles in your terminal and run:
make.sh

The compilation and execution should happen immediately, and once you've ran make.sh at least once, you should be able to run:
./cfiles/banco

If you want to debug the program, you could run:
./cfiles/debug.sh

This enables an option to see the file, function, and line where everything is being executed.
